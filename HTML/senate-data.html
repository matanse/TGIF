            <p>First convened in 1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are established in Article
                One of the U.S.
                Constitution. Each state is represented by two senators, regardless of population, who serve
                staggered six-year terms.

                        <h1>About Us</h1>
                        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                            transparency is government's
                            obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
                            public officials
                            accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>

                        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                            business and spend taxpayer money
                            must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
                            governance. Transparency
                            promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is
                            doing.</p>

                        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                            Government's effectiveness and
                            improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public
                            officials benefit from
                            having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively
                            engaged in American
                            government.</p>

                        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                        public feedback to
                        identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                        <p>Background History of Government Transparency
                            In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to
                            public opinion dates back at
                            least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
                            doctrine of state secrecy, a
                            core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to
                            this end can also be traced to
                            this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                            territory) enacting free press
                            legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and
                            that of the philosophes
                            more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                            sphere.</p>

                        <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                            freedom of the press enshrined
                            provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
                            constitutional articles. In the
                            nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                            vigorously opposed by a
                            number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among
                            the latter.</p>

                        <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and
                            is often linked to the
                            passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted
                            the first freedom of
                            information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth
                            century and Finland continuing
                            the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity
                            of Official Documents in
                            1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                        <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                            Information Acts (AIAs) or
                            equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>

                        <h1>Congressmen</h1>
                        <p>The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire country,
                            although its bills must
                            also be passed by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming law
                            (unless both the House and
                            Senate re-pass the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber). The House has
                            some exclusive powers: the
                            power to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials (impeached officials are subsequently
                            tried in the Senate), and to
                            elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College.

                            Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population as measured in
                            the census, but every state
                            is entitled to at least one representative.</p>
